# Explanation of Matches

[Zingg Enterprise Feature](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Entity resolution is more effective when you can observe how clusters form, connect, and evolve across runs. Once you have run a `match`  or `incrementalRun` phase, you may like to look under the hood to understand how a cluster got formed and which records matched with each other and which did not. This insight helps with the following:

* Model Training and Validation: Quickly check if results match expectations.
* Traceability: See exactly how clusters are formed over time.
* Governance: Explain results to business stakeholders.
* Human-in-the-loop Reviews: Share pair-level evidence with domain experts.
* Operational Confidence: Build trust in production pipelines.
