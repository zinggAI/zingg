# Finding The Matches

`./zingg.sh --phase match --conf config.json`

As can be seen in the image below, matching records are given the same **z\_cluster** id. Each record also gets a **z\_minScore** and **z\_maxScore** which shows the _least/greatest_ it matched with other records in the same cluster.

If records across multiple sources have to be matched, the [link phase](link.md) should be used.
