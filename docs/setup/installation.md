# Installation

Zingg runs on [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) and can be used on all major Spark distributions. Zingg can run on all major Linux flavors.&#x20;

Zingg can be installed from the [release on github](../stepbystep/installation/installing-from-release/), [built from sources](../stepbystep/installation/compiling-from-source.md) or used [directly through Docker](../stepbystep/installation/docker/). The next sections describe each option in more detail.&#x20;
