## Find training data and labelling them 

This phase is composed of two phases namely [findTrainingData](./findTrainingData.md) and [label](./label.md). This will help experienced users to quicken the process of creating Training data.

`./zingg.sh --phase findAndLabel --conf config.json`

  It's note that this option is good for small datasets else if your findTrainingData takes a long time, the user will have to wait for the console for labelling. For details, refer to the individual phases: [findTrainingData](./findTrainingData.md) and [label](./label.md)
