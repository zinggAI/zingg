# Running On Databricks

You can run Zingg on Databricks directly using the Databricks notebook interface. All [file formats and data sources and sinks](../dataSourcesAndSinks/) are supported within Databricks.

This uses the Zingg Python API and an [example notebook is available here](../../examples/databricks/FebrlExample.ipynb)
