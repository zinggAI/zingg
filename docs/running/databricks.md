# Running On Databricks

You can run Zingg on Databricks directly using the Databricks notebook interface. All [file formats and data sources and sinks](../dataSourcesAndSinks/) are supported within Databricks.

This uses the Zingg Python API and an [example notebook](../../examples/databricks/FebrlExample.ipynb) and a [step by step guide](https://www.zingg.ai/documentation-article/identity-resolution-on-databricks-for-customer-360) is available.

**For Zingg Enterprise on Databricks, we also support Databricks Unity Catalog.**
