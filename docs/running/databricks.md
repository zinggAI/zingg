You can run Zingg on Databricks directly using the Databricks notebook interface. All file formats, data sources and sinks are supported within Databricks. 

This uses the Zingg Python API and an [example notebook is available here](https://github.com/zinggAI/zingg/blob/main/examples/databricks/FebrlExample.ipynb)
