# Installing From Release

Zingg is prebuilt for common Spark versions so that you can use those directly. The following document assumes that we are installing Zingg 0.3 on Spark 3.1.2, but you can follow the same process for other versions too.

## Prerequisites

A) Java JDK - version "11.0.23"

B) Apache Spark - version spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3
