# Model Location

#### zinggDir

The location where trained models will be saved. Defaults to /tmp/zingg

#### modelId

An identifier for the model. You can train multiple models - say, one for customers matching names, age, and other personal details and one for households matching addresses. Each model gets saved under zinggDir/modelId
