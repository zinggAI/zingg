# Setting Up Zingg Development Environment

Welcome to the Zingg development setup guide. To provide you with the most accurate instructions, please select your operating system:

* [**macOS Setup Guide**](./macOSSetup.md)
* [**Ubuntu / WSL2 Setup Guide**](./ubuntuSetup.md)

---

If you're using a different Linux distribution, the Ubuntu instructions will likely be the most relevant, but you may need to adjust package management commands (e.g., using `yum` or `dnf` instead of `apt`).
