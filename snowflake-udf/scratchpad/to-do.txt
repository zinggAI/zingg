sklearn logistic regression multiple independent variables

number of independent variables (X) could be any => value between 0 and 1

(ASSUMPTION : ALL X PRESENT , NONE MISSING AND ALL FLOAT)

dependent (Y) only 1 => value 0 or 1

What's remaining:

1. How to insert the result back into DB
2. test by running it
3. why should we need connection inside UDF? it is already sitting inside DB
4. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html
